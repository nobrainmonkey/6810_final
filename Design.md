## Project Objectives

### Tools Related Learning

- [X] Learn How to use a version control software connected with a remote repository.

### Computationally solve the problem of a 2-D two-level Ising model with a given Hamiltonian under a magnetic field $H$.

- [X] Microstate generation.
- [ ] Micro-sate visualization. (Maybe omitted)
- [ ] Micro-sate enumeration using Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm (MCMC).
- [ ] Observables calculation.
- [ ] Parallel computing using `Openmp`.

### Graphical Representation
- [ ] Graph calculated observables under different conditions.
- [ ] Maybe explore more graphing software than `gnuplot`. As my research area is in nuclear physics, maybe I will try out `root`.

### Error Analysis
- [ ] Microstate operations error analysis.
- [ ] Observable calculation error analysis.
- [ ] Total error analysis.

### Writing
- [ ] Summary, write-up, and potential improvements.
