## Project Objectives

- [X] Learn How to use a version control software connected with a remote repository.

- [ ] Computationally solve the problem of a 2-D two-level Ising model with a given Hamiltonian under a magnetic field $H$.
  - [X] Microstate generation.
  - [ ] Micro-sate visualization. (Maybe omitted)
  - [ ] Micro-sate enumeration using Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm (MCMC).
  - [ ] Observables calculation.
  - [ ] Parallel computing using `Openmp.`

- [ ] Graph calculated observables under different conditions.
  - [ ] Maybe explore more graphing software than `gnuplot`. As my research area is in nuclear physics, maybe I will try out `root`.

- [ ] Error Analysis:
  - [ ] Microstate operations.
  - [ ] Observable calculations.

- [ ] Summary, write-up, and potential improvements.
