## Project Design Overview

### Design Philosophy

The ultimate goal of this project is to **solve a physics problem in the best way I could think of.** This means that instead of re-inventing the wheel and writing my own `matrix` class and my own `numerical` packages, I do want to mainly use packages avaliable online for the best performance/accuracy purposes. I will probably implement some hand-written integration/derivative methods, but those are not going to be included in `main.cpp`- they are just to show that I learned some computational method in this course.

### Technology stack

#### Matrix Computation:

For matrix related computation, I have decided to use `eigen`. After doing some research on the internet, I learned that `eigen` is the most canonical choice for doing dense matrix operation and it is in many cases blazingly fast.

Because the problem serves to solve a 2-D MCMC problem, `eigen`'s lack of high-dimensional array methods wouldn't be an issue. If I wanted to solve for higher dimensional arrays, I could use `blitz++`.

#### Numerical Methods:

For numerical methods such as numerical integration and derivatives, I have decided to use `GSL`. I think `GSL` is already very optimized for speed and it has all the numerical methods I wanted.

#### Graphs:

For graphing macroscopic observables, I decide to try out `matplotlib-cpp`. This decision is not final, as plotting is not very integral to my detailed abstraction of my project. I might write an wrapper for `gnuplot` instead. My PI will make me learn `root` eventually, so that is probably also an option.

For graphing the microstates, I actually want to achieve this via some simple terminal `ASCII` graphing by myself. This should be rather simple as I will just be representing a matrix with entries `-1` or `1`. Using black and white is very sufficient for this purpose.

## Project Design Details

### Object Oriented Programming

Because we are using `c++`, we should embrace the modularity of `OOP`. This means that we seek to maximize the readability and adaptability of our code. Below are the necessary objects and their structure for this program.

#### Microstate

The `Microstate` class should inlucde everything we need to describe the microstate of out spin system. This should include **a complete microscopic description of our microstate.** However, any macroscopic quantities will Not be covered here. Because we are dealing with a 2-D lattice, we shall use a 2-D array from `eigen` to represent this state.  To define this lattice, we must define the row number and col number.

The `Microstate` class should have the following structure

```
class Microstate (int row, int col)


// Hamiltonian class need to access the number of row and col.
private: 
int rownum = row 
int colnum = col 
// function prototype for initialize microsate
mat* Initialize_matrix(int row, int col)
// Create initial matrix 
mat* microstate_matrix = Initialize_matrix(rownum, colnum)

// getter and setter function for row, col, and microstate_matrix




// Initialize the microsotate to be a row X col matrix with random values from -1 to 1 defined by eigen
mat * Initialize_matrix(int row, int col){
mat A = new mat (row, col, fill:randomu)
for (i=0; i < row; i++){
	for(j = 0; j < col; j++){
		if A(i, j) < = 0 -> A(i,j) = -1
		else A(i,j) = 1
	}
}
return * mat A
}

```

#### Hamiltonian

The main function of our Hamiltonian class is to **calcuate the energy of a given microsate.** Because energy is a macroscopic quantity, we probably will never deriectly utilize this class in our `main` function, but this Hamiltonian will be used for our macroscopic quantities' calculation. This probably won't be a class but merely a header file and source file for other classes.

```
Hamiltonian.h

double hamiltonian_ising_function(int i, int j, void * hamiltonian_param)
// code the hamiltonian here, return the ith row and jth col energy for ising model-> E = - J sum_<ij> S_i S_j - h* S_i
// where J, h are stored in param

double Get_ising_element_energy(microstate* microstate, int i, int j, &hamiltonian_ising_function)
// return the ith row, jth col spin energy calculation using hamiltonian_ising_function
// where <ij> stands for the nearest neightbor of spin located at (i,j) with periodic boundary condition

double Get_ising_microstate_energy(microstate* microstate, &hamiltonian_ising_function)
//return the total energy of the entire microstate by intrearting through every element of the microstate 
//and calling Get_element_energy()


```

Note:

* The nearest neightbor of periodic B.C. will probably be some what difficult. Now all I can think of is using `mod` operator. I might seperate this part out to another function in this class.

#### MC

MC package here should perform the markov-chain matropolis algorithm.  The algorithm should do the following:

* We start from a random microstate. (by passing a microstate)
* We flip a random spin in that microstate.
* If the microstate energy becomes lower, we accept this change.
* If the microstate energy becomes higher, we accept this change with probablity $e^{-\Delta E/T }$
* Iterate for a large number until we reach equalibrium.

Therefore, `MC` should have the following structure Note that as we are using MC as a calculator, this should merely be a header file with its sourcecode.

```
#include 'Hamiltonian.h'




```
